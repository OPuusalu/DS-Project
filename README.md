# Project Overview

## Motivation
The motivation for the project came from the recommended project ideas PowerPoint showcased to us in class. This particular idea seemed interesting to our team and we decided to attempt to accomplish it.

## Goal
The main goal of this project was to predict, based on given synthesized data, whether a person diagnosed with lung cancer would survive for 5 years after the diagnosis.

## Contents
